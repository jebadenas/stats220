## Physical Activity Analysis
```{r}
#calculating the mean hours per week spent on physical activity 
hours_per_week_mean <- latest_data$hours_per_week %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)

#getting the max hours someone exercised out of data sample
hours_per_week_max <- latest_data$hours_per_week %>%
  max(na.rm = TRUE)


#bar charts

#physical activity type coloured by if individual want more time for physical activity
physical_activity_by_want_time <- latest_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(y= physical_activity_type, fill = want_more_time)) +
  labs(title = "Want more time by physical activity type",

### Some Summary Statistics!
On average, participants engage in **`r round(hours_per_week_mean, 1)` hours** of physical activity **per week**.

The most active participant exercised for **`r hours_per_week_max` hours in a single week!**

### Bar Charts
The bar graph below indicates that gym/strength training are the most popular physical activities among participants who wish they had more time to engage. Interestingly, even individuals who currently do not participate in any physical activity express a desire to have more time to start. Less popular activities, such as sports and "Other," show the lowest levels of engagement. Among the most chosen activities—walking and gym/strength training—the majority of participants express wanting more time for physical activity. 
```{r}
physical_activity_by_want_time
```

From the graph below, we can see that a significant majority consider physical activity important, whereas a much smaller group believe it is not. This highlights a strong consensus among the surveyed group on the importance of staying physically active.
```{r}
no_of_people_importance
```
